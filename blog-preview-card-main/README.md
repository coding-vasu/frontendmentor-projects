## Overview

### The challenge

1. See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

    ### Screenshot: Hover

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about he `<time>` tag, which is a tiny time machine for our web page. It's like putting a digital timestamp on our content that both humans and computers can understand.

The <time> tag is used to represent a specific period in time, such as a date, a time, or a combination of both. It's especially useful for events, publication dates, or any time-related information you want to highlight.


```html
<p>
  The next solar eclipse will occur on
  <time datetime="2024-04-08T17:59:00Z">April 8, 2024 at 5:59 PM UTC</time>.
</p>
```
In this example, the visible text shows a human-readable date and time, while the datetime attribute provides a machine-readable format.

```css
/* Changing root font size scales all rem-based elements proportionally */
@media screen and (max-width: 28.5rem) {
  :root {
    --base-font-size: 12px; /* default: 16px */
  }
}

/* Smooth transition for hover effects */
.blog-preview {
    transition: box-shadow 0.4s ease-in-out, color 0.4s ease-in-out;
}

.blog-preview:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
    box-shadow: 1rem 1rem 0 0 black;
    color: var(--color-primary);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time) - This helped me to understand time tag. This is like a bible for html.
- [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) - In each lesson, you‚Äôll be given an introduction to a single Markdown concept. Then, you‚Äôll be asked to complete several exercises with that new knowledge.
