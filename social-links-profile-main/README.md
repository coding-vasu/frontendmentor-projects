## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Clamp For Responsiveness

### What I learned

I have learned to use ARIA for this project, ARIA provides enhanced semantics and accessibility for web content.

```html
<main class="profile-card" aria-label="Jessica Randall's profile card">

<!-- Her role-"list" is the aria property -->
<ul class="profile-card_social-links" role="list"> 

```
Learned new property of link tag `<a>`
```html
<li><a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="profile-card_links">GitHub</a></li>
```
`noopener`: This attribute prevents the newly opened page from having access to the original pageâ€™s window object.

`noreferrer`: This attribute prevents the browser from sending the HTTP referrer header to the destination site.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about using `clamp` for building responsive layouts. Additionally, I need a better understanding of grid layout.

### Useful resources

- [Font Size Clamp](https://clamp.font-size.app/?config=eyJyb290IjoiMTYiLCJtaW5XaWR0aCI6IjM3NXB4IiwibWF4V2lkdGgiOiIxNDQwcHgiLCJtaW5Gb250U2l6ZSI6IjEzLjY0OHB4IiwibWF4Rm9udFNpemUiOiIxNnB4In0%3D) - This tool assists in creating responsive websites by asking for minimum and maximum values and then generating the appropriate clamp.

- [color name](https://www.color-name.com/hex/ffffff) - This site provides the name for any color based on its hex code.
