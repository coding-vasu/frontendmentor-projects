## My process

### Built with

- Got to more about list attributes & pseudo classes like `::marker`
- Hands on with table
- Lastly accessibility (ARIA labeling & Tab Indexing).

### Continued development

- Clamping Guide & Techniques
- Able to isolate the problem, in order to focus on the issue & resolve it.
